## Hardware Assumptions
CPU-based execution, no GPU required.

## Runtime Estimates
Typical interview session: 6–10 minutes.

## Random Seed Handling
Seed fixed in experiment YAML files.
LLM nondeterminism acknowledged.

## Sources of Nondeterminism
- LLM sampling
- Network latency
- Vision model variability

## Cost Considerations
API usage dependent on interview length.
No large datasets used.
