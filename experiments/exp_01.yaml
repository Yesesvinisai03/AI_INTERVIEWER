description: >
  This experiment evaluates resume-based retrieval using a RAG pipeline.
  Resume text is cleaned, chunked, embedded, and indexed in ChromaDB.
  Retrieved chunks are used to generate resume-aware interview questions.

  Qualitative relevance of retrieved resume chunks and their alignment
  with generated interview questions.

notes: >
  This experiment corresponds to the Resume RAG Exploration notebook
  and validates the semantic retrieval component of the system.
