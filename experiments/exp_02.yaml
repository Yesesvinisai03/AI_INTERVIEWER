  generation, evaluation strictness, and feedback across different input
  modalities, including text-only answers and whiteboard-based explanations.

metric: >
  Differences in evaluation labels, feedback tone, follow-up questions,
  and strictness across personalities and evaluation modes.

notes: >
  Whiteboard vision analysis is executed in the main application.
  Notebook experiments document whiteboard behavior and fallback logic
  to ensure reproducibility without external API dependency.
